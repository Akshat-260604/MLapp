Crafted and Developed a Python-based machine learning app using Streamlit, enabling users to upload
images for automatic animal identification. Implemented image recognition model for seamless and
interactive user experience.

First, use and run ipynb file for training the CIFAR-10 model by fine-tuning various hyperparameters such as learning rate, epochs, batch size according to your computational capabilities.
Then, make the final Machine Learning model i.e. run main.py file. Open the terminal and write "streamlit run main.py".
After that the local host will open up and the ine=terface of streamlit will be visible on your screen. That's it. Enjoy feeding in your friend's images to find out whether they resemble to a dog or a donkey :)
